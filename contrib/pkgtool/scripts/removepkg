# Use /var/lib/pkgtools for the package database, not /var/log.
# Logs of the removed packages and scripts will remain in /var/log, but moved
# into /var/log/pkgtools.
#
# Sun May 27 18:02:23 UTC 2018
# Added --terse mode to print one line per removed package.
#
# Wed May 23 17:31:23 UTC 2018
# Use file locking to prevent more than one copy of ldconfig from running at
# a time.
#
# Thu Sep 15 17:46:28 UTC 2016 <volkerdi>
# If removepkg is called with a short package name (no -$VERSION-$ARCH-$BUILD),
# remove the most recently installed matching package, not the oldest one.
#
# Thu Sep 15 08:09:01 BST 2016 <mozes>
# - Handle finding >1 match for a package.  Thanks to SeB on LQ for the feedback.
#
# Wed Sep 14 20:44:00 BST 2016 <mozes>
# - Modify package_name function to cater for package file names that contain
#   >=4 hyphens.
#   Thanks to coralfang on LQ for the report and to Jim Hawkins for the patch.
# - Modified to handle packages that contain file names with backslashes
#   Thanks to aaazen on LQ for the report and the patch.
#
# Thu Sep 24 03:31:58 UTC 2015 <alphageek>
# extract_links() sed adjusted to handle symlinks with spaces.
#
# Sun Sep  6 21:58:36 BST 2009
# Replaced pkgbase & package_name code with 'sed' script by Jim Hawkins.
#
# Sat Apr 25 21:18:53 UTC 2009 (12.34567890b)
# Converted to use new pkgbase() function to remove pathname and
# valid package extensions.
#
# Revision 12.34567890 Sun Apr  5 20:59:32 CDT 2009 <volkerdi>
# - Support packages with the extensions: .tgz, .tbz, .tlz, .txz
#
# Revision 1.9 Wed Oct 31 14:04:28 CDT 2007 volkerding
# - Fix problem removing packages with a large number of fields.
#   Thanks to Niki Kovacs for noticing this, and to Piter Punk
#   for the patch.
# - Use LC_ALL=C locale, which is much faster with "sort".
#   Thanks to Tsomi.
# - Don't try to remove any package that starts with '-'.  This
#   is not a proper package name (usually a typo), and results
#   in the package database being broken.  Thanks to Jef Oliver.
# - Patched cat_except() to allow the last Slackware package on
#   a partition to be removed (using ROOT=, of course)
#   Thanks to Selkfoster for the patch, and to everyone else who
#   proposed solutions before.  This issue really wasn't given
#   the highest priority before, but I figured while I'm in here...
#
# Revision 1.8 Thu Nov 22 14:00:13 PST 2001 volkerding Rel $
# - Move $TMP underneath $ROOT
# - Understand the idea of a base package name, so that packages
#   can be removed with any of these notations:
#   removepkg foo-1.0-i386-1.tgz
#   removepkg foo-1.0-i386-1
#   removepkg foo.tgz
#   removepkg foo
#
# Revision 1.7  2001/03/30 12:36:28 volkerding
# - Strip extra ".tgz" from input names.
#
# Revision 1.6  1999/03/25 18:26:41 volkerding
# - Use external $ROOT variable, like installpkg.
#
# Revision 1.5.1  1998/03/18 15:37:28 volkerding
# - Since removepkg is always run by root, the temp directory has been
#   moved from /tmp to a private directory to avoid symlink attacks from
#   malicious users.
#
# Revision 1.5  1997/06/26 12:09:53  franke
# - Fixed old bug in TRIGGER regex setting
# - -preserve/-copy options now preserve non-unique files
#   and empty directories also
#
# Revision 1.4  1997/06/09 13:21:36  franke
# - Package file preserve (-preserve, -copy) added.
# - Don't execute "rm -rf" lines from doinst.sh, removing links explicit.
# - Warning on no longer existing files added.
# - Warning on files changed after package installation added.
# - Intermediate file preserve (-keep) added.
# - Check for required files/links now done on a combined list.
# - Write access to /var/log/{packages,scripts} no longer necessary for -warn.
#
# Revision 1.3  1997/06/08 13:03:05  franke
# Merged with revision 1.1.1.1
#
# Revision 1.2  1996/06/01 20:04:26  franke
# Delete empty directories & formated manual pages added
#
# Revision 1.1.1.1  1995/12/18 21:20:42  volkerding
# Original Version from Slackware 3.1

# Needed to find package names within the 'remove_packages' function:
shopt -s extglob

# Return a package name that has been stripped of the dirname portion
# and any of the valid extensions (only):
pkgbase() {
  # basename + strip extensions .tbz, .tgz, .tlz and .txz
  echo "$1" | sed 's?.*/??;s/\.t[bglx]z$//'
}

# This makes "sort" run much faster:
export LC_ALL=C

# Set the prefix for the package database directories (packages, scripts).
ADM_DIR="$ROOT/var/lib/pkgtools"

# Set the prefix for the removed packages/scripts log files:
LOG_DIR="$ROOT/var/log/pkgtools"

# Make sure there's a proper temp directory:
TMP=$ADM_DIR/setup/tmp
# If the $TMP directory doesn't exist, create it:
if [ ! -d $TMP ]; then
  mkdir -p $TMP
  chmod 700 $TMP # no need to leave it open
fi
