Usage: makepkg package_name.tgz
       (or: package_name.tbz, package_name.tlz, package_name.txz)

Makes a Slackware compatible package containing the contents of the current
and all subdirectories. If symbolic links exist, they will be removed and
an installation script will be made to recreate them later. This script will
be called "install/doinst.sh". You may add any of your own ash-compatible
shell scripts to this file and rebuild the package if you wish.

options:  -l, --linkadd y|n (moves symlinks into doinst.sh: recommended)
          -p, --prepend (prepend rather than append symlinks to an existing
               doinst.sh.  Useful to link libraries needed by programs in
               the doinst.sh script)
          -c, --chown y|n (resets all permissions to root:root 755 - not
               generally recommended)
          --threads <number> For xz/plzip compressed packages, set the max
               number of threads to be used for compression. Only has an
               effect on large packages. For plzip, the default is equal to
               the number of CPU threads available on the machine. For xz,
               the default is equal to 2 (due to commonly occuring memory
               related failures when using many threads with multi-threaded
               xz compression).
          --compress <option> Supply a custom option to the compressor.
               This will be used in place of the default, which is: -9
          --acls Support storing POSIX ACLs in the package. The resulting
               package will not be compatible with pkgtools version < 15.0.
          --xattrs Support storing extended attributes in the package. The
               resulting package will not be compatible with pkgtools
               version < 15.0.

If these options are not set, makepkg will prompt if appropriate.
