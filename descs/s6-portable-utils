# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

s6-portable-utils: s6-portable-utils (Tiny portable generic utilities) 
s6-portable-utils: 
s6-portable-utils: A set of tiny general Unix utilities, often performing well-known 
s6-portable-utils: tasks such as cut and grep, but optimized for simplicity and small
s6-portable-utils: size. They were designed for embedded systems and other 
s6-portable-utils: constrained environments, but they work everywhere. 
s6-portable-utils: Some of s6-portable-utils' programs are a conformant implementation 
s6-portable-utils: of a POSIX utility as determined by the Single Unix Specification, 
s6-portable-utils: version 4; the relevant documentation pages mentions this. However, 
s6-portable-utils: none of the s6-portable-utils programs supports internationalization.
