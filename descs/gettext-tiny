# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

gettext-tiny: gettext-tiny (Lightweight replacement for GNU Gettext)
gettext-tiny:
gettext-tiny: This provides lightweight replacements for tools typically used from
gettext-tiny: the GNU gettext suite, which is incredibly bloated and takes a lot
gettext-tiny: of time to build (in the order of an hour on slow devices). the most
gettext-tiny: notable component is msgfmt which is used to create binary
gettext-tiny: translation files in the .mo format out of textual input files in
gettext-tiny: .po format. this is the most important tool for building software
gettext-tiny: from source, because it is used from the build processes of many
gettext-tiny: software packages.
