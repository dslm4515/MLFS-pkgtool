# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

gdbm:
gdbm: GDB, the GNU Project debugger, allows you to see what is going on 
gdbm: inside another program while it executes - or what another program
gdbm: was doing at the moment it crashed. GDB can do four main kinds of
gdbm: things to help you catch bugs in the act: 1) Start your program,
gdbm: specifying anything that might affect its behavior. 2) Make your
gdbm: program stop on specified conditions. 3) Examine what has happened,
gdbm: when your program has stopped. 4) Change things in your program.
