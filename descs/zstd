# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

zstd: Zstandard, or zstd for short, is a real-time compression algorithm
zstd: providing high compression ratios. It offers a very wide range of
zstd: compression/speed trade-off, while being backed by a very fast
zstd: decoder. It also offers a special mode for small data, called
zstd: dictionary compression, and can create dictionaries from any sample
zstd: set.
