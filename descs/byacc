# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

byacc: Berkeley Yacc (byacc) is generally conceded to be the best general- 
byacc: purpose parser generator available. It converts a grammar description
byacc: for a LALR(1) contect-free grammar into a C program to parse that 
byacc: grammar. In contrast to bison, it is written to avoid 
byacc: dependencies upon a particular compiler.
