# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

llvm-unwind: llvm-unwind (LLVM's Unwinder Library)
llvm-unwind:
llvm-unwind: An implementation of the interface defined by the HP libunwind 
llvm-unwind: project. It was contributed by Apple as a way to enable clang++ to 
llvm-unwind: port to platforms that do not have a system unwinder. It is intended
llvm-unwind: to be a small and fast implementation of the ABI, leaving off some 
llvm-unwind: features of HPâ€™s libunwind that never materialized (e.g. remote 
llvm-unwind: unwinding).
