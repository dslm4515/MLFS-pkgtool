# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

bison: program to parse that grammar. Bison is upward compatible with Yacc:
bison: all properly-written Yacc grammars ought to work with Bison with no
bison: change. Anyone familiar with Yacc should be able to use Bison with
bison: little trouble.
