# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

lzip: lzip (a lossless data compressor)
lzip:
lzip: Lzip is a lossless data compressor with a user interface similar to
lzip: the one of gzip or bzip2. Lzip decompresses almost as fast as gzip
lzip: and compresses more than bzip2, which makes it well suited for
lzip: software distribution and data archiving. Lzip is a clean
lzip: implementation of the LZMA algorithm.
